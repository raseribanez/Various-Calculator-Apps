# Various-Calculator-Apps
A collection of other calculators based on mathematical formulas used a lot (by me)

===========================================================================================================

All are written in Python and Tkinter which is built in - requirements are Python 2.7 unless otherwise stated
At this level of coding, to get a program to run on Python 3 ALL you have to do is edit the import line
and change Tkinter to tkinter (no Caps on the T)

==========================================================================================================

All calculations used in the software are the most widely used formulae

All of my calculators have been cross checked using online calculators and other sources

==========================================================================================================

I welcome any improvements, contributions to code, and want to know if there are any errors or problems

I also would like to know if any of these get used for any real-life applications. Any feedback is welcomed!

Enjoy
